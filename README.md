## Rusty Merkle Tree

The goal is to implement a simple Merkle Tree in Rust.
- A Merkle Tree can be built out of an array.
- A Merkle Tree can generate a proof that it contains an element.
- A Merkle Tree can verify that a given hash is contained in it.
- A Merke Tree can be dynamic, this means that elements can be added once it is built.
